# Pelias

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mapzen/pelias.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mapzen/pelias)

Pelias is a set of tools for importing [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) data into [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), and a simple server to handle queries and autocomplete suggestions.

## Requirements

* _PostgreSQL_: You'll need a postGIS-enabled database with OpenStreetMap data, imported with [osm2pgsql](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql).
  NOTE: The import process expects certain fields, so you'll need to use the style file here: config/osm2pgsql.style
* _Elasticsearch_: For Search download the latest version of [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/)
* _Redis_: Geonames lookup for quattroshapes cross-referencing
* _Sidekiq_: Used for background processing (also uses Redis)
* Ruby >= 2

## Usage

To get set up, run the following.

### Get the code and bundle to download dependencies

    $ git clone git@github.com:mapzen/pelias.git && cd pelias
    $ bundle

### Prepare synonyms

    $ bundle exec rake synonyms:build

### Set up the index & mappings:

    $ bundle exec rake index:create

### Prepare geonames

Geonames provide nice alternative names and populations for locations.  We
cross-reference this data with quattroshapes in the next step in order to
provide a better search experience.

    $ bundle exec rake geonames:prepare

### Insert quattroshapes

These are shapes for various administrative shapes. They are provided by the
http://quattroshapes.com/ project.

NOTE: These tasks are enqueued via Sidekiq and must be run in isolated steps.
You can run them inline by using the environment variable `ES_INLINE=1`.

    $ bundle exec rake quattroshapes:prepare_all
    $ bundle exec rake quattroshapes:populate_admin0 ES_INLINE=1
    $ bundle exec rake quattroshapes:populate_admin1 ES_INLINE=1
    $ bundle exec rake quattroshapes:populate_admin2 ES_INLINE=1
    $ bundle exec rake quattroshapes:populate_local_admin ES_INLINE=1
    $ bundle exec rake quattroshapes:populate_locality ES_INLINE=1
    $ bundle exec rake quattroshapes:populate_neighborhood ES_INLINE=1

### Add OSM data

Assuming you've set up a postGIS-enabled database with OSM data, the following
will add all streets and addresses to the index, reverse geocoding them into
the above shapes.

    $ bundle exec rake osm:populate_street
    $ bundle exec rake osm:populate_address
    $ bundle exec rake osm:populate_poi

## Start the server

    $ unicorn

You should now be able to access the server at http://localhost:8080/suggest?query=party

## Setup Performance Information

The following is a brief synopsis of setting up this environment including: approximate times to complete each step, amount of data, number of documents, etc.

### Architecture/Tuning for a FULL PLANET index in shortest time period

* PostgreSQL/PostGIS: 1 c3.8xlarge
  * this is only to facilitate the fastest of initial load times into pelias
* Elasticsearch: 20 m3.2xlarge
  * optimization work to be done to lessen on heap storage requirements
  * assumes 80 shards, 1 replica per shard, half of physical memory allocated to ES for heap
* Sidekiq: 8 c1.medium
  * only required for initial import to complete in a timely manner
  * can be removed once complete or scaled back as required for updates on an ongoing basis

Using this hardware allocation, we also recommend the following during the initial data load:
* disable replication in elasticsearch
* set the index refresh interval to something north of an hour (or disable it altogether for the duration of the indexing process)
* in PostgreSQL, add the following index (this will take some time if you're working with a full planet installation):
  * `CREATE INDEX limit_street_line ON planet_osm_line (name, highway);`

### Load Times

Using the above architecture, we've observed the following load times:
* geonames + quattroshapes: roughly an hour
* osm: ~3 days

### Data Footprint

Documents in Elasticsearch upon completion of load:
* ~66 million

Unique data size on disk:
* ~300GB
  * ~600GB with one replica

## API

### search

This is our search endpoint.  This is used to search the index for addresses,
POIs, etc.

```
/search?query=brooklyn
/search?query=brooklyn&center=-74.08,40.77
/search?query=brooklyn&viewbox=-74.08,40.77,-73.9,40.67
/search?query=brooklyn&viewbox=-74.08,40.77,-73.9,40.67
```

### suggest

This is an autocomplete suggestion endpoint.  It provides search suggestions
given text to look up.

```
/suggest?query=bro
/suggest?query=bro&size=5
```

### reverse

This is the reverse geocoding endpoint.  It takes `lng` and `lat` params and
returns GeoJSON corresponding to the given location.

```
/reverse?lng=1&lat=2
```
